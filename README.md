# Project Description

Welcome to our application! This project aims to provide a seamless and secure authentication experience while offering essential features such as user registration, authentication via Google or Microsoft accounts, and navigation through various pages.

Features

1. Application Setup
   The application supports authentication through both Google and Microsoft accounts.
   Users can register using a standard registration system, providing only a username and password, without requiring mobile or email confirmations.
2. Authentication and Authorization
   Users can log in using either their Google account or manually registered credentials.
   Upon successful login, users are redirected to the home page, where they are greeted with the message, "This is the home page."
   Automatic redirection to the home page is implemented for users who were previously logged in, ensuring a seamless user experience.
3. Pages and Navigation
   An "Orders" page is available, displaying the message, "This is the order page."
   Unauthorized access to the Orders page is restricted; users attempting to access it without authentication are redirected to the login page.
   Best practices for routing and authentication flow have been implemented to enhance usability and security.
4. Project Documentation and Setup
   The project is hosted on GitHub for easy access and collaboration.
   Detailed documentation is provided to guide users through setting up and running the application locally, ensuring a smooth development experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook .github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
